			</b>First of all--after finishing the Arms I freaked out and had to
take a day off. 			I came back and was VERY confused as to how the hell
I was going to attatch the Upper 			Body to the Lower Body. If I could
do this over again (ARGH!) I would have probably 			built from the top
to the bottom or vice versa. It was EXTREMELY difficult to bring
			together to two halves. Here's what I came up with. Hang with me if
you can....<br>
			<br>
			It starts with this giant cylander with two support strips running
through the sides 			of it.</td>

			</b>Hmmmm. So this is the cylinder from Photo 42 put on top and
around the mega-cylinder 			from way back on the First Day of the
Spring Break build (see <a href="cbm2.html">CHAPTER 			2</a>). The
support strips block the new cylinder from dropping any lower and gave
			me something on the inside to glue onto. <br>

			I must admit, looking at this photo now I don't exactly understand
what I was doing 			at this point but I know it was really complicated

			So now the Upper Body can REST on the Lower body in the position
that it will be 			when it is attatched. The height is correct, but I
have still not connected the two 			sections of the CBM. I was getting
pretty excited but also worried about the last 			few steps which I

folded it so 			there were FIVE faces. Then I folded and hot-glued it
so that it made a rectangular 			support with one extra face making a
diagonal in the middle for extra support. I 			then attatched the HELL

			</b>It is hard to acurrately describe how difficult this step was.
When you are working 			with Hot Glue in LARGE areas it is very tricky.
Because as you spend more time spread 			more glue the FIRST glue that
you spread is "drying" or "cooling" 			which means it is USELESS. So I
think I let my hot glue gun sit for 1/2 an hour to 			REALLY heat up.
Then I had to pour out ALL THIS GLUE and then QUICKLY and ACCURATELY
			place the large, cumbursome top half onto the lower half. Talk about
stressful!!!<br>
			<br>
			I burned my hands and fingers more inbetween Photo 46 and Photo 47
than I care to 			ever do so again. After getting the two pieces
attached I spent almost an hour dripping, 			spreading, smearing and
forcing hot glue into the VERY hard-to-reach guts of the 			CBM for
reinforcement. But it was worth it. Because that was it. He was
finished. 			What a great great feeling.</td>

			</b>Jesus. Here's my fucking disaster area of a room. The major
tools are prominently 			displayed. The cord of my hot glue gun can be
seen on the upper left. I kept it on 			the window sill so the fumes
wouldn't set off the Dorm fire alarm system. <br>
			<br>
			My green 30' Stanley Lever-lock tape measure was used for most of
the major measurements 			although I used the big blue and red ruler
quite a bit as well. <br>
			<br>
			And of course the Leatherman. At this point I had started using my
Leatherman Crunch 			because I had dulled the blade on my Leatherman
Wave. Serrated blades work exceptionally 			well for cutting cardboard,
let me tell you!<br>
			<br>
			I went through a whole crap-load of boxes during the construction of
the CBM. A lot 			of it I had been saving throughout the year--"I'll
use this later. Mwaa haa 			haaa!" I also would go out at night and
look behind dorms for cardboard boxes 			which I would steal and use.</td>

great, that's 			all I can say. I wore the same shirt for four days and
did not shower or shave for 			that time period as well. Please notice
that the CBM has his arm around my shoulder. 			I might look all pissed
off and angst-ridden but really I was brimming with pride.<br>
			<br>
			Also during the CBM construction I was struck by the idea for this
T-Shirt on which 			I wrote "Brand Name &copy;." I firmly believe that
during this week my 			mind was in an elevated state of creative
awareness. Nice lightsaber....</td>
