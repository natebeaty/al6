      <h2>The Cardboard Monkey
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>For all of my childhood summers I went to Hidden Valley Camp.
At the end of each 			session of camp you make a "friendship" present
for another person at camp. 			This one year when I was 14 (or so) I
made a Cardboard Monkey for a little boy named 			Robert. His favorite
animals were monkeys, so I made him this one out of cardboard. 			It
was my first venture into creating cardboard mammals. 		</p>

			</b>Unfortunately, this picture is the only documentation of the
Cardboard Monkey. 			I think the concept was simple though. He
basically worked on MUPPET technology. 			I hand slot in the back for
operating the mouth and head and then two dowels that 			could be used
to operate the arms of the monkey. The monkey was MOSTLY cardboard,
			but I think I used cloth to get the interior of the mouth and I used
wooden dowels 			for the arm-rods.</td>

      <h2>James Cameron
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>My friend, Gabe Carleton-Barnes, had a hole in his ceiling
during his Sophomore 			year at Oberlin College. During that year's
Winter Term Gabe was gone and a bunch 			of foul-smelling liquid
drained through the hole and onto his pillow. Since the pillow 			was
ruined I attatched some cardboard appendages and a head and made James
Cameron. 			I would say that this was all an EVOLUTIONARY process, but
that would imply that 			James Cameron is more evolved than a monkey...

			</b>This was definitely NOT a pure cardboard project. If I remember
correctly, I 			ran pieces of coat hangers through the pillow to hold
the cardboard into place. In 			this, the only surviving photo of James
Cameron, he is seen wearing my flanel shirt 			and a hat. In a maddened
rage one day I ripped James off the wall dragged him out 			to the
hallway and beat the ever-loving shit out of him with my lightsaber. I
didn't 			stop until all of his cardboard appendages were severly
damaged. I still have the 			head somewhere... Most of my hatred for
James Cameron stems from the fact that his 			crappy movie "Titanic"
bumped "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" 			from the #1 slot of
highest grossing films of all time. This is one of the ways I 			delt
with that.</td>

      <h2>Social Night
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>My Sophomore year I lived with three other guys (Gabe
Carleton-Barnes, Michael 			Cardiff and Samuel Greenberg) in the QUAD.
We decided that instead of wandering around 			trying to find people to
hang out with, we would have a party EVERY friday night 			and that way
we would force people to come to us. All the other guys drink alcohol,
			I do not. When "Social Night" (as it was deemed) would start, I would
go 			into the sleeping room and work on the Cardboard Man. People
would check on me through 			the night and see how I was getting along.
I think this whole thing started on a 			whim-- "I'm going to build a
man out of cardboard." --That sort of thing. 		</p>

measurements of my 			feet so that the they are the right size. There
is also a lot of internal framework 			which makes the feet sturdy. In <a

			</b>The Legs were pretty straight forward. The knee joint is a
simple Rod and Tube 			system (sort of how a toilet paper roll works).
It provides the legs with up-down 			mobility. There are support
"beams" every few inches to make sure that 			the legs are extra
sturdy. It doesn't seem like much work, but this is as far as 			I got
during my Sophomore year. I had completed a lot of the drawings (see <a
 href="cbm7.html">CHAPTER 			7</a>) for further steps, but this was as
much as I had built.</td>

      <h2>THEA 222
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>Almost a year later I took THEA 222 - "Introduction to Design"
We had 			an assignment to make a three-dimensional sculpture
describing one of the characters 			from William Shakespeare's
"Macbeth." I saw my oportunity and went for 			it. I made a version of
Macbeth's severed head out of cardboard and based the looks 			(and
measurements) on my own face at the time. It wasn't DIRECTLY for the
CBM, but 			knew where it was going.... 		</p>

			</b>Unfortunately I do not have a photo from the BACK of this
project. But basically 			it was just a MASK. There was a flat plane in
the back, just behind the ears in which 			it terminated. Inside the
mask was covered with black paper and the eyes were translucent 			so
that they could be seen from the inside as well. <br>
			<br>
			Later on that year Frunch and Gabe had a "Social Night Revival" at
their 			new room. In typical QUAD style, I brought along this mask and
converted it to work 			with the Cardboard Man project. I gutted the
inside elements, replaced the eyes with 			cardboard ones and built out
the rest of the head and neck. If memory serves, I did 			not have
enough HOT GLUE that night, so I could not cover the new back of his
head 			with "hair" (ripped up brown paper bags).</td>
