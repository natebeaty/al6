Plans - 1/15/2000</b>
      <hr> <br>
      <br>
At the beginning I remember talking about this project with my QUAD
roommates.  I 			was asking them what they thought about it, and how I
should make the joints.  My 			roommate Sam said something to the
effect of, "Hey.  If you are going to build 			a man out of Cardboard
then I think the WHOLE THING has to be Cardboard."  I 			agreed and so
I set out to figure out which joints I was going to have to figure
			out with CARDBOARD.<br>
      <br>
This drawing is also important because it determined the mobility of
the CBM.  For 			structural purposes and ease of building I did not
give full mobility to all of the 			joints.  For example the ankle
joints do not rotate.</td>

      <h2>An Exercise in Drafting
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>All of this Cardboard Man madness was going on during my
Sophomore year at college. 			 At that time I was just learning how to
draft as well.  So part of the appeal of 			this project early on was
that I was going to make detailed scale drawings of every 			step of
the process.  I put in as much work into the first few drawings as I
did 			in constructing the CBM.  It was essential to have a working
drawings for figuring 			out which pieces to cut and what size they had
to be, etc. etc. 		</p>

This was the first drawing, and it's probably the one I'm the most
proud of.  The 			feet look EXACTLY like this drawing.  This was all
back when I was drafting with 			a protracter, a scale ruler and a
mechanical pencil.  No drafting table, no erasing 			sheilds, no
T-square.  OLD SCHOOL. <br>

I should also note that I took carful measurements from my own body
throughout the 			process to supply measurements for the drawings.<br>

      <h2>Just Enough to Get the Job Done
      <hr> </h2>
			
      <p>There have been a few occasions where I have given people some
pointers on mechanical 			drafting (mostly for Theatrical Technical
Direction).  And one thing that I always 			emphasize is that if YOU
are going to be the one building from your OWN drawings 			then only
make them as complicated as they need to be.  If someone ELSE has to
build 			from your drawings, they better be well laid-out, clearly
dimensioned and easy to 			understand.  But if it's just for you, you
can save a lot of time and energy by drawing 			just enough so that you
understand how to put it together.</p>
			
      <p>That was how I approached these drawings, which were drawn
during the crazy Spring 			Break 2001 build (see <a href="cbm2.html">CHAPTER
2</a>).  And that being said, even 			<b>I</b> look at these drawings
now and have very little idea what is going on. 			I was EXTREMELY
involved in this project during that week.  It was the only thing 			I
was thinking about from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to
sleep. 			 So the drawings got pretty "loose."  		</p>

Madness!  I don't really understand how this drawing led to the
connection of the 			upper and lower sections of the CBM--but this was
it!  I think it's funny that I 			called this a "Preliminary PLAN"
instead of a "Preliminary SKETCH" 			(like I had with all the previous
