      <p>This is my web documentary about the construction of the
Cardboard Man. Basically 			he is a scale model of ME made entirely out
of cardboard and put together with hot 			glue. NO, I did not build him
for a class or a project or something. I was not FORCED 			to build the
cardboard man, I did it for FUN.</p>
			
      <p>Here are some simple statistics about the cardboard man:</p>
			
      <ul>
				<li>He has 16 points of articulation 				</li>
        <li>15 - 20 lbs of cardboard 				</li>
        <li>175+ hot glue sticks 				</li>
        <li>1 piece of 100 grit sandpaper (for stubble) 				</li>
        <li>1 brown paper bag (for hair) 			</li>
      </ul>
			
      <p></p>
			
      <p>The web documentary is broken down into sections
chronologically. Follow the links 			and see HOW I built this man of
cardboard and also hear the STORY of what was going 			on in my life
while I was working on him. 		</p>

			<br>
			My junior year of college I canceled all of my plans for Spring
Break so that I could 			spend time with my girlfriend, Kate. Then a
few days before it started we broke up. 			Needless to say, I had a lot
of excess negative energy. I needed to focus that energy 			somewhere
or I was going to freak out. So I decided that I would lock myself in
my 			room from 8am to 10pm every day/night that week until the
Cardboard Man was complete. 			Chapter 2 supplies photographs 1-12 of
the infamous Spring Break build.</td>

cardboard with my Leatherman. Chapter 5 collects photographs 42-50
